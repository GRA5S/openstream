# This website is for educational purposes only, I am not distrubuiting these movies, this is just a wrapper for https://moviesapi.club


### link to site: https://openstream.thegrass.xyz/

A site built in [Reflex](https://reflex.dev) that uses the [MoviesAPI.club](https://moviesapi.club) and the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) api for movies streaming of thousands of movies for 100% free.

Search, streaming, recomended and getting info about movies are all features of the site that can be had for free and with barely any loading times.



### Self hosting:
To self host and for developmentyou need python 3.11 or above[^1] 
in terminal, navigate to the `movie_streaming_site` folder and run 

`python -m pip install -r /requirements.txt`

Once done, create a file called `.env` and using notepad write

`
auth="{YOUR TMDBAPI KEY HERE}"
`

and replace `{YOUR TMDBAPI KEY HERE}` with an api key from [TMDB api](https://developer.themoviedb.org/v4/reference/intro/getting-started)



[^1]:version 3.11 or above is fine, older versions may work but I haven't tested them
